    <h2>// Background</h2>
    <p>
      I'm 18, living in Kuching, Sarawak with my family, and currently taking foundation studies 
      on information technology and multimedia at Swinburne Sarawak. I also did countless side projects 
      during secondary school.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have great passion for electronic music and video games. They allowed me to open new perspective 
      and to think outside the box.

    <h2>// Proficiencies</h2>
    <p>
      I had fiddled with many kinds of development, including games, softwares and web. As a result, I 
      speak C#, HTML and CSS well. I also understand languages such as JavaScript, Lua, Python and SQL 
      thorughout my projects. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've utilised many IDEs, including Visual Studio and VS Code. I've had extensive use of specialized 
      softwares, such as Unity, Adobe Photoshop, Inkscape, Blender and MySQL Workbench. In terms of web 
      frameworks, I am proficient with jQuery, Vue, Jekyll and Hexo.
