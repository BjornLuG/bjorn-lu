Hi, this is my personal website, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), with a pinch of [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

## Installation

The site uses Jekyll for static site generation. It is a ruby gem, so Ruby is needed to be installed.

You can do so by following [Jekyll's Installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to setup the environment on your machine.

After installation, you can start Jekyll via the [CLI](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/). It's also recommended to prepend `bundle exec` before all commands to make sure the correct version of Jekyll is used.

Common CLI usage are listed below:

To run dev server:

``` bash
# Build files and serve locally
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To build site:

``` bash
# Build site for production
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```
