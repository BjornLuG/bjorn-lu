  overview: A GitHub Action to automate submitting a Reddit post of a release
  learned:
    - This was my submission for <a href="https://githubhackathon.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Hackathon</a>
      . I had previous experience with GitHub Actions by helping with prebuilt
      binaries in <a href="https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2/pull/242" target="_blank">node-argon2</a>
      , but building an action from scratch gave me a great insight on GitHub's
      approach to CI/CD, which is highly flexible and extensible compared to
      other solutions.

    - After having much experience with frontend work, this project provided
      some great insight on how backend communicates with the client and how
      it works with a database.
    - Moreover, I also wrote tests using Jest to familiarize myself with
      Test-driven development (TDD). Besides, I practiced documenting the
      README more, which will help in the long run.

  overview: A single page app (SPA) to visualize Material Design's elevations
    (shadows) and dynamically generate its CSS
  learned:
    - This was my first serious project with Vue. I initially started off
      without a UI framework, but as the components get more complex, it
      became time-consuming to re-invent the wheel so I opt for
      <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com" target="_blank">Vuetify</a> instead.
    - The trickiest part was to display the highlighted code and to enable
      copy and download functionality. Alas, they are solved with
      <a href="https://highlightjs.org" target="_blank">Highlight.js</a> and
      some JavaScript sorcery.

  desc: Animate stuff in Rainmeter easily
  overview:
    A Lua library that works with Rainmeter to easily tween meters. It uses
    <a href="https://github.com/kikito/tween.lua" target="_blank">tween.lua</a>
    , a Lua tweening library to bind into usage in Rainmeter.
  learned:
    - This was the first time I had to use a dynamically-typed language.
      Before this, I only ever used C# for Unity development.
    - It was easy to adopt at first, but once the library grew substantially,
      it needed lots of refactoring and documenting to be able to safely add
      extra functionalities.
