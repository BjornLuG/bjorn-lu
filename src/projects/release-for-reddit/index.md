A GitHub Action to automate submitting a release on Reddit.

## What I've Learned

This was my submission for [GitHub Hackathon](https://githubhackathon.com/). I had previous experience with GitHub Actions by helping with prebuilt binaries in [node-argon2](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2/pull/242), but building an action from scratch gave me a great insight on GitHub's approach to CI/CD, which is highly flexible and extensible compared to other solutions.
