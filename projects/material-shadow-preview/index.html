  <h2>What I've learned</h2>
  <p>
    Working with Vue was a ton of fun, I get to focus on the content and logic rather than on panning
    the structure. I initially started off without a component UI framework, but as components get more
    complex, it became time-consuming to reinvent the wheel so I opt for
    <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com">Vuetify</a> instead. The hardest part was to display highlighted code
    and to enable copy and download of it. Alas, they are solved with <a href=https://highlightjs.org">Highlight.js</a>
    and some JavaScript sorcery.
