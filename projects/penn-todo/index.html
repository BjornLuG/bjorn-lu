  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    A todo app built on the PENN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, Nuxt, Node.js).
    It provides email authentication and manage todos. It's mainly an app for me to explore backend
    by building REST APIs and databases.

  <h2>What I've learned</h2>
  <p>
    After having much experience in frontend, this project provided some great insight on how backend
    functions and how it works along with a database. Moreover, I also wrote tests using Jest to
    familiarize myself with Test-driven development (TDD) in which I learned to make my code more testable.
    Besides, I practice the habit of documenting the README, which in the end covers many topics for
    the project and is more coder-friendly.
