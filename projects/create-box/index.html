  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Create Box is a simple website to create rounded boxes and shadows. 
    It was made as a practice to refresh my skills with vanilla JavaScript.

  <h2>What I've learned</h2>
  <p>
    The project relied heavily on HTML canvas, which I had avoided for a long time due to its complexity. 
    I initially opted for <a href="https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/">HTML2Canvas</a> for the box generation, 
    but it didn't have a solid support for box shadows. So I decided to roll out my own generation system, 
    turns out the Canvas API wasn't all that hard, working with it was a breeze!
