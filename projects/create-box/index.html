  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Create Box is a simple website to create rounded boxes and shadows. 
    It was made as a practice to refresh my skills with vanilla JavaScript.

  <h2>What I've learned</h2>
  <p>
    The project relied heavily on HTML canvas, which I had avoid for a long time because of its complexity. 
    Initially, I opted for 
    <a href="https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML2Canvas</a> 
    for the box generation, but since it didn't have a solid support for box shadows, I decided to roll out my 
    own generation system. Turns out it was really simple! I was amazed of how easy it was to convert the 
    data to PNG too.
